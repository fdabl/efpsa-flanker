# efpsa-flanker

Implements a simple Flanker task. It was written for my workshop about *Crowdsourcing and the Interwebs*, held at the EFPSA 2014 [Congress](http://more.efpsa.org/congress2014/) in Romania.
You can check out the workshop materials themselves [here](http://workshop.dablscience.org). It gets you up to speed with online experiments and crowdsourcing your research.
This Flanker task is simply a subset of [this](https://github.com/dostodabsi/crowd-flanker) experiment.

Run the experiment with
```
git clone https://github.com/dostodabsi/crowd-drawing
cd crowd-drawing
npm install

node db/create.js # create the database
node index.js # run the app on localhost:4000
```
